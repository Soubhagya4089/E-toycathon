I designed a custom ESP8266 PCB in Fusion 360 and developed the robotâ€™s electronic circuit, integrating sensors like IMP441, IMU, and IR, along with servo motors and speakers. The humanoid bot responds to claps, talks back, dances, walks on uneven surfaces, and is controllable via a remote or mobile app.
